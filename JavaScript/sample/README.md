# JavaScript sample project
This sample project is based on the awesome [Modern JavaScript Explained For Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70) guide.

It explains some very useful stuff:
* Using a JavaScript package manager
* Using a JavaScript module bundler
* Transpiling code for new language features
* Using a task runner

Note: instead of sharing the node_modules folder, you only need to share the package.json file and other developers can install the required packages automatically with the command <code>npm install</code>.
