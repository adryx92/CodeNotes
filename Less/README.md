## Compile and minify
You can compile and minify code thanks to the [less-plugin-clean-css](https://github.com/less/less-plugin-clean-css) plugin using [clean-css](https://github.com/jakubpawlowicz/clean-css).

First you have to install it trough npm: 
<code>npm install less-plugin-clean-css -g</code>.

Then run <code>lessc -clean-css style.less style.min.css</code>.
